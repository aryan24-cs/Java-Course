        // there are different tyoe of cases in time complexity
        
        // 1. Best Case: the minimum time taken by the algorithm for any input size.omega notation is used to represent the best case.
        

        // 2. Average Case: the average time taken by the algorithm for all possible inputs of a given size.omega notation is used to represent the average case.

        // 3. Worst Case: the maximum time taken by the algorithm for any input size.big O notation is used to represent the worst case.


        //Space Complexity: relation between input size and space taken by the algorithm

        //it can be constant, linear, logarithmic, quadratic, etc.

        //it is usually represented using big O notation as well, similar to time complexity.

        //Example: 
        //For an algorithm that processes an array of size n:
        //Time Complexity: O(n) - linear time complexity, as it processes each element once.
        //Space Complexity: O(1) - constant space complexity, if it uses a fixed amount of extra space regardless of input size.
